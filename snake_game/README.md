# Snake Game
---

#### In black board, a single white snake keeps moving to eat blue food.
#### When the snake eats the blue food, the snake grows and grows.
#### You do not have to _hit the walls_ and _run into its body._
#### If you do those things above, you lose the game. Be careful!

#### I hope you enjoy this game!
